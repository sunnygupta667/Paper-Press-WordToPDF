## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** (v6.x or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-to-pdf-converter.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the zip file from GitHub and extract it on your system.

2. **Navigate to the project directory** (both client and server folders):
   - In your terminal, navigate to the root folder of the repository.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   You need to install dependencies separately for both the client and server.

   - For the **client**:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

   - For the **server**:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

## Running the Project
After installing the dependencies, you can run the project.

1. **Start the Client:**
   - In the `client` folder, run the following command:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

2. **Start the Server:**
   - In the `server` folder, run the following command:
     ```bash
     npm run server
     ```

Once both the client and server are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
